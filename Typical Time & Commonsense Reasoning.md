# 3. Typical Time & Commonsense Reasoning

## 3.1. Typical Time
**"Create training questions about the typical timing of activities and events. Each question must:**  
- Describe a common situation or activity (meals, work hours, school schedules).  
- Require estimating reasonable timing based on cultural and social norms.  
- Provide sufficient context about location, culture, or industry to determine the expected timing.  
- Apply to various activities: office hours, commuting times, meal times, event durations.  
- Require identifying an accurate time range (not just a single time point).  
- Sometimes differentiate between regions, cultures, or contexts.  
- Include details that influence timing (weekday, season, special events).  

**Only provide the question with full details and context, without giving the answer."**  

## 3.2. Commonsense Facts
**"Create training questions about common knowledge related to time. Each question must:**  
- Describe a real-world situation where time is implicitly understood.  
- Require reasoning based on general world knowledge.  
- Cover diverse fields: work, education, healthcare, transportation, entertainment.  
- Include varied question types:  
  - Estimating suitable durations (How long does a full meal take to cook?).  
  - Identifying appropriate event timing (When is the best time to send a work email?).  
  - Judging the plausibility of time claims (Is a 6-hour meeting reasonable?).  
  - Recognizing implicit time rules (Impact of being 30 minutes late for an interview).  
- Challenge the ability to apply real-world time and cultural knowledge.  
- Provide specific situations with enough detail to guide reasoning.  

**Only provide the question with full details and context, without giving the answer."**
