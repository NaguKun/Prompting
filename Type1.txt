Generate a diverse set of mathematical temporal reasoning questions that involve duration calculation. Each question should provide a start time and a duration in various formats (minutes, hours, or days). Ensure that:

The output includes both 12-hour and 24-hour formats.
The scenarios are realistic and varied, such as train schedules, movie durations, work shifts, and exams.
Some questions require finding the start time given the end time instead of the other way around.
Few-shot Examples:
Example 1:
Context: A train departs from City A at 08:30 AM and travels for 4 hours 20 minutes.
Q: What time will the train arrive at City B?

Example 2:
Context: An exam ends at 15:45 and has a total duration of 2 hours 30 minutes.
Q: What time did the exam start?

Example 3:
Context: A patient must take medicine every 6 hours. The first dose was taken at 09:15 AM.
Q: What time should the next dose be taken?

Generate mathematical temporal reasoning questions that involve time shifting. Each question should specify a reference time (current time, date, or day of the week) and ask for the resulting time after a given shift. Ensure diversity in:

Short-term shifts (hours, days).
Medium-term shifts (weeks).
Long-term shifts (months, years).
Some questions should involve time zones for advanced reasoning.
Few-shot Examples:
Example 1:
Context: Today is Wednesday.
Q: What day of the week will it be in 10 days?

Example 2:
Context: A project starts on March 5, 2024, and lasts 3 months and 10 days.
Q: What is the completion date?

Example 3:
Context: A flight departs from New York at 11:30 PM (EST) and has a 12-hour duration. The destination is in a timezone 5 hours ahead.
Q: What time will the flight arrive at the destination?

Generate mathematical reasoning questions that require frequency counting of recurring events. The events can occur daily, weekly, or at custom intervals. Ensure that:

Some questions involve simple recurrence (e.g., twice per week).
Others involve custom intervals (e.g., every 45 minutes, every 3 days).
Scenarios should be realistic, including work shifts, class schedules, bus departures, and medication timings.
Few-shot Examples:
Example 1:
Context: A bus departs every 30 minutes from 06:00 AM to 10:00 PM.
Q: How many buses run in one day?

Example 2:
Context: A gym class is held every Tuesday and Thursday. A month has 4 full weeks.
Q: How many gym sessions take place in a month?

Example 3:
Context: A worker has a 6-hour shift and can work a maximum of 40 hours per week.
Q: What is the maximum number of shifts the worker can take in one week?

Generate complex mathematical temporal reasoning questions that require multiple time calculations in a sequence. Each question should involve:

At least two time operations (addition, subtraction, breaks, waiting times, or transfers).
A real-world context, such as work schedules, travel itineraries, or event planning.
Some problems should require backward calculations (e.g., determining a start time from an end time).
Few-shot Examples:
Example 1:
Context: A worker starts a shift at 08:45 AM, works for 3 hours 15 minutes, takes a 30-minute lunch break, then works for 4 more hours.
Q: What time does the worker finish their shift?

Example 2:
Context: A train departs at 21:10 and travels for 5 hours 40 minutes. After arrival, there is a 1-hour 20-minute maintenance stop before continuing for another 3 hours 50 minutes.
Q: What is the final arrival time?

Example 3:
Context: A music concert starts at 18:30 and consists of:

First act: 1 hour 20 minutes
Break: 15 minutes
Second act: 2 hours 10 minutes
Q: What time does the concert end?
