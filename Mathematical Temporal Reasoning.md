# 1. Mathematical Temporal Reasoning

## 1.1. Arithmetic
**"Create training questions that require performing calculations with time. Each question must:**  
- Contain exact numerical values and time units (hours, days, weeks, months, years).  
- Require operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or unit conversion.  
- Include real-world scenarios (work schedules, travel time, study plans).  
- Have varying levels of complexity (from simple to multi-step problems).  
- Occasionally include calculations requiring special handling (e.g., converting 60 minutes to 1 hour).  
- Provide clear context to motivate problem-solving.  

**Only provide the question and context, without giving the answer."**  

## 1.2. Duration
**"Create training questions about calculating the duration between two points in time. Each question must:**  
- Clearly state two specific time points with full details (date, hour, minute if necessary).  
- Require calculating the duration in the appropriate unit (hours, days, weeks, months, years).  
- Include various situations: within a day, across days, across months, and across years.  
- Address special cases: leap years, time zone conversions, daylight saving changes.  
- Provide real-world contexts: flight schedules, working hours, vacations, project deadlines.  
- Require precise calculations (to the day, hour, and minute) in some cases.  
- Add complexity with holidays, weekends, and work hours.  

**Only provide the question with full details and context, without giving the answer."**  

## 1.3. Frequency
**"Create training questions about the frequency of an event occurring within a given period. Each question must:**  
- Clearly describe the frequency of the event (every 15 minutes, once every 3 days, weekly on Tuesday).  
- Specify a concrete time range (from date/time X to date/time Y).  
- Require calculating the total occurrences of the event within the given period.  
- Include real-world scenarios: medication schedules, workout plans, meeting schedules, equipment maintenance.  
- Cover special cases: events skipping holidays/weekends.  
- Include complex frequencies: every 10th and 25th of the month, first Monday of the month.  
- Introduce constraints and exceptions: skipping holidays, changing schedules in specific cases.  

**Only provide the question with full details and context, without giving the answer."**  

## 1.4. Time Shift
**"Create training questions about calculating time after a shift. Each question must belong to one of the following types:**  

### Short-Term Shift:
- Ranges from a few hours to a few days.  
- Clear initial time point (specific date, hour, and minute).  
- Real-world contexts: assignment deadlines, meeting times, delayed flight schedules.  

### Medium-Term Shift:
- Ranges from weeks to months.  
- Deals with month changes, quarter transitions, and seasonal shifts.  
- Real-world contexts: project timelines, school schedules, contract deadlines.  

### Long-Term Shift:
- Spans multiple years.  
- Considers leap years, decade changes, and century transitions.  
- Real-world contexts: long-term planning, multi-year contracts, age and milestone events.  

### Month/Year Shift:
- Adjusts by full months or years.  
- Handles special cases: January 31st + 1 month = ?  
- Applied in financial planning, contracts, anniversaries.  

Each question must include a specific initial time point, a clear time shift, and require determining the new time. Complexity may include time zones, lunar/solar calendars, or special rules where applicable.
