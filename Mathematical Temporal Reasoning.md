## 1.1. Arithmetic
"Create training questions that require performing calculations with time. Each question must:

Have exact numerical values and time units (hours, days, weeks, months, years)
Require summation, subtraction, multiplication, division, or unit conversion
Include real-world scenarios (work schedules, travel time, study plans)
Vary in complexity (from simple to multi-step calculations)
Occasionally involve special cases (e.g., converting 60 minutes into 1 hour)
Provide clear context to motivate problem-solving
Only provide the questions and context, do not include answers."

## 1.2. Duration
"Create training questions about calculating the time interval between two points. Each question must:

Clearly state two specific time points with full date, hour, and minute (if necessary)
Require calculating the duration in appropriate units (hours, days, weeks, months, years)
Cover various scenarios: time within a day, across days, across months, and across years
Include special cases: leap years, time zone conversions, daylight saving time changes
Provide real-world contexts: flight schedules, work hours, vacations, project deadlines
Require precise calculations (to the exact day, hour, minute) in some cases
Introduce complexity such as holidays, weekends, and business hours
Only provide questions with full details and context, do not include answers."

## 1.3. Frequency
"Create training questions about the frequency of events within a time period. Each question must:

Clearly describe the event frequency (every 15 minutes, once every 3 days, weekly on Tuesdays)
Define a specific time range (from which date/hour to which date/hour)
Require calculating the total number of occurrences within that period
Include real-world scenarios: medication schedules, workout plans, meeting schedules, equipment maintenance
Incorporate special cases: events not occurring on holidays/weekends
Include complex frequencies: on the 10th and 25th of each month, on the first Monday of the month
Add constraints and exceptions: not occurring on public holidays, schedule changes in certain cases
Only provide questions with full details and context, do not include answers."

## 1.4. Time Shift
"Create training questions about calculating a new time point after a time shift. Each question must fall into one of the following categories:

Short-term shifts:

Changes ranging from a few hours to a few days
Clearly defined initial time point (specific date, hour, minute)
Real-world scenarios: assignment deadlines, meeting times, flight delays
Medium-term shifts:

Changes spanning a few weeks to a few months
Handling month transitions, quarter shifts, seasonal changes
Real-world contexts: project planning, academic schedules, contract deadlines
Long-term shifts:

Changes spanning multiple years
Considering leap years, decade/century shifts
Contexts: long-term planning, multi-year contracts, age and milestone events
Month/year-based shifts:

Adjusting by full months or years
Handling special cases: January 31 + 1 month = ?
Applications: financial scenarios, contracts, anniversaries
Each question must have a specific starting time, a clear time shift, and require determining the new time point. Introduce complexity such as time zones, lunar/solar calendars, or special rules where applicable.

Only provide questions with full details and context, do not include answers."
