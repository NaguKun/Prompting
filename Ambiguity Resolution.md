# 4. Ambiguity Resolution

## 4.1. Ambiguity
**"Create training questions that involve resolving temporal ambiguity. Each question must:**  
- Present a scenario where time expressions are unclear or open to multiple interpretations.  
- Use ambiguous phrases like "next Friday," "in two weeks," "the following Monday."  
- Require determining the most likely or intended interpretation.  
- Include different contexts: work schedules, travel plans, event planning.  
- Sometimes involve cultural or regional variations in interpretation.  
- Provide enough context to allow for resolution, though some uncertainty may remain.  
- Introduce varying levels of ambiguity, from mild to highly confusing.  

**Only provide the question with full details and context, without giving the answer."**  

## 4.2. Interpretation
**"Create training questions that test the ability to interpret temporal references in context. Each question must:**  
- Feature a passage or conversation containing time-related information.  
- Require extracting or deducing the correct time reference.  
- Include different types of time expressions: specific dates, relative time ("yesterday," "in three days"), vague references ("sometime soon").  
- Cover diverse domains: news articles, historical texts, casual conversations, technical documents.  
- Include cases where multiple interpretations exist, requiring contextual understanding.  
- Occasionally involve conflicting time references, requiring resolution.  
- Require precise identification of the intended time.
