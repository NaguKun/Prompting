#### **1. Typical Time (Common Durations of Activities)**
**Prompt:**
Generate 10 high-quality questions that require reasoning about the typical durations of daily activities. The questions should be culturally neutral and based on real-world experiences such as sleep, cooking, commuting, and exercise. Avoid numerical calculations that require exact values; instead, focus on approximate and commonly accepted durations.

**Guidelines:**
- The activity should be something universally relatable (e.g., "baking a cake," "driving to work," "watching a movie").
- The expected time duration should be reasonable based on common knowledge.
- Avoid niche or technical activities that require specialized knowledge.
- Ensure variation in difficulty (some should be straightforward, others requiring multi-step reasoning).

**Output Format:**
- **Context:** A short, realistic scenario.
- **Q:** A question asking about the typical duration of the activity.

**Examples:**
**Context:** An average adult needs a certain amount of sleep to stay healthy and function properly.
**Q:** How many hours does an adult typically sleep each night?

**Context:** Most full-length movies at the cinema include previews before the main film starts.
**Q:** If a movie is scheduled to start at 7:00 PM, at what approximate time will it end?

#### **2. Commonsense (General Knowledge About Time & Seasons)**
**Prompt:**
Generate 10 commonsense reasoning questions about time, seasons, and culturally neutral time-related concepts. The focus should be on intuitive knowledge that most people would reasonably know, rather than specific factual details. Topics may include seasonal changes, holiday periods, and general time-based expectations in daily life.

**Guidelines:**
- Avoid region-specific or culturally biased examples (e.g., "Christmas is in December" may not apply universally, but "Winter months are colder than summer months" is more neutral).
- Include questions that require logical deduction rather than pure memorization.
- Ensure diversity in topics, such as time-of-day reasoning, seasonal knowledge, and typical schedules.

**Output Format:**
- **Context:** A short scenario description.
- **Q:** A question requiring commonsense reasoning about time.

**Examples:**
**Context:** Many students around the world get a long vacation during a specific period of the year.
**Q:** During which months do students typically have summer break?

**Context:** In most places, the sun rises in the morning and sets in the evening.
**Q:** Around what time does the sun usually rise?

#### **3. Facts (Time-Related Social Conventions & Universal Truths)**
**Prompt:**
Generate 10 well-structured questions that focus on widely accepted time-related facts, emphasizing social norms, routines, and universal time-related concepts. These questions should reflect everyday experiences and general time-based conventions rather than mathematical calculations.

**Guidelines:**
- The facts should be universally applicable (e.g., "A year has 12 months" rather than "New Yearâ€™s Eve is on December 31st").
- Avoid questions that require deep scientific or historical knowledge.
- Ensure that the questions are engaging and relevant to daily life.
- The format should encourage straightforward, factual responses without requiring interpretation.

**Output Format:**
- **Context:** A short, realistic scenario.
- **Q:** A question about a factual time-related concept.

**Examples:**
**Context:** Many cities experience rush hour traffic when people commute to work in the morning.
**Q:** Around what time does morning rush hour usually begin?

**Context:** A year is divided into a fixed number of months.
**Q:** How many months are there in a year?
