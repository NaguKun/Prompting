# 2. Temporal Ordering & Causality

## 2.1. Ordering
**"Create training questions about sequencing events in chronological order. Each question must:**  
- Describe a sequence of 4-7 events within a story or scenario.  
- Present events out of order.  
- Provide explicit and implicit time clues (before, after, during, in the morning).  
- Use natural language with varied expressions of time.  
- Include different types of clues: specific timestamps, before-after relationships, causal indicators.  
- Apply to various contexts: workflow processes, travel plans, historical event sequences.  
- Require arranging all events in the correct chronological order.  

Ensure sufficient information to deduce the correct order.  

**Only provide the question and context, without giving the answer."**  

## 2.2. Cause-Effect
**"Create training questions about cause-effect relationships between events. Each question must:**  
- Describe a situation with 3-5 related events.  
- Provide clear causal indicators (leads to, causes, results in, because of).  
- Require identifying which event caused a specific outcome.  
- Include contextual details to support causal reasoning.  
- Cover diverse fields: business, science, history, daily life.  
- Have varying complexity (direct and indirect causation).  
- Occasionally include distracting elements or unrelated events.  

**Only provide the question with full details and context, without giving the answer."**  

## 2.3. Multi-Event Causality
**"Create training questions involving complex causal chains. Each question must:**  
- Describe a scenario with at least 4-6 causally linked events.  
- Form a clear cause-effect chain: A → B → C → D.  
- Include at least one branching path: A → B → C, but also A → E → F.  
- Feature both direct and indirect links, primary and secondary causes.  
- Provide enough details to clearly determine event relationships.  
- Apply to real-world cases: business processes, technical failures, social issues.  
- Require explaining the full causal sequence from the initial event to the final outcome.  
- Occasionally include feedback loops: A → B → C → A (reinforcing).  

Ensure the context is complex enough to challenge reasoning but remains solvable.
